Tcl-DP API for C
----------------

The file, dpApi.c, contains functions that can be used to contact a
Tcl-DP server and for sending RPCs and RDOs for evaluation by the server.
dpApi.c does not depend on Tcl in any way, so it is ideal for applications
that do not contain Tcl, yet need to connect to a Tcl-DP server.

Overview
--------


DpServer Dp_ConnectToServer(int inetAddr, int port);

Opens a connection to a Tcl-DP RPC server.  Note that the remote server
must have been opened using dp_MakeRPCServer or this function will fail.
-1 will be returned if there was an error.  Both arguments should be
given in host byte order.


char *Dp_RPC(DpServer s, char *msg, struct timeval *tv, int *errorPtr);

This is the function used to send an RPC to server s.  msg is the Tcl
string to evaluate and tv is the timeout length (or NULL for infinite).
errorPtr will be non-zero when the function returns if there was an
error and the return value will be an error message.  Otherwise the
return value is the return value of the remote evaluation of the RPC.


int Dp_RDOSend(DPServer s, char *rdoStr, int flags);

Sends an RDO, rdoStr, to a Tcl-DP RPC server s.  flags is a combonation of
DP_REPORT_ERROR and DP_RETURN_VALUE.  These act the same as the -callback
and -error flags in the DP API.  Returns the amount of data sent to the
server (should be strlen(rdoStr)).


char *Dp_RDORead(DPServer s, int *errorPtr);

Receives a response from a previous RDO.  This will block forever if there
is no response to an RDO (e.g. asking for an error return but there is
no error).  Returns the Tcl return string or, if errorPtr is non-zero,
an error message.


int Dp_WaitForServer(DPServer s, struct timeval *tv);

Sleeps until there is a message from the server or tv expires.  If tv is
NULL, we will block until data is received from the server.  Returns 0
if we timed out, < 0 if there was an error or > 0 if the socket is
now readable.
