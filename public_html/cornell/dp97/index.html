<p><font size="5"><b>Abstract</b></font></p>

<p>Tcl-DP is a loadable module for Tcl that adds advanced
communication features to Tcl/Tk. Tcl-DP supports communication
by serial links, IP-multicast, TCP, UDP, and email, contains a
remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism, and supports the design of
new protocols using modules called <i>filters</i>. Tcl-DP 1.0
[Smi93] was released four years ago and has since been used for
numerous commercial and academic projects. With age, however, the
code became so brittle that adding new features and porting to
new versions of Tcl was nearly impossible. Furthermore, many of
Tcl-DP&#146;s original features were incorporated in the Tcl
core, making them redundant in Tcl-DP. Hence, we decided to write
the latest version of Tcl-DP (version 4.0) from scratch. In this
paper, we describe the new features of Tcl-DP 4.0, its
architecture and implementation, and problems we encountered with
Tcl&#146;s new I/O system.</p>

<p><font size="5"><b>The Tcl-DP API</b></font></p>

<p>The Tcl-DP API contains two main parts: commands for general
communication and command for remote procedure call (RPC). Figure
1 demonstrates Tcl-DP&#146;s RPC mechanism by showing how to
implement a network-wide server for generating unique
identifiers. The left side of the figure shows the code that is
executed on the server, the right side shows the code that is
executed on the client.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><img src="dp97.h2.gif"
width="567" height="164"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3">Figure 1 -- A Simple ID server</font></p>

<p>The first command executed on both client and server is the
Tcl <font face="Courier New">package</font> command, which makes
Tcl-DP library functions and commands available in the current
Tcl interpreter. The server executes the <font face="Courier New">dp_MakeRPCServer</font>
command, which creates a socket that is waiting for a client to
connect. Finally, the server defines the <font face="Courier New">getID</font>
command, which generates and returns a unique identifier.</p>

<p>The client connects to the server using the <font
face="Courier New">dp_MakeRPCClient</font> command, which returns
a handle that can be used to communicate to the server. Finally,
the client invokes the <font face="Courier New">getID</font>
command on the server using the <font face="Courier New">dp_RPC</font>
command. This causes a message containing the command to be
evaluated to be sent to the server, where it is evaluated and the
results returned.</p>

<p>Tcl-DP also contains commands to support basic network
communication. Figure 2 shows how to use Tcl-DP&#146;s
communication facilities to transfer the file <font
face="Courier New">/etc/motd</font> from a client machine to the
server (alvin.cs.cornell.edu).</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><img src="dp97.h3.gif"
width="578" height="250"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3">Figure 2 &#150; Simple network
communication</font></p>

<p>After loading Tcl-DP using the <font face="Courier New">package</font>
command, the server uses Tcl-DP&#146;s <font face="Courier">dp_connect</font>
command to create a TCP socket that is waiting for a connection
on port 1944. The server then issues the <font face="Courier New">dp_accept</font>
command, which blocks until a client connects, and then returns a
handle for the newly connected client. Once a client is
connected, the server opens <font face="Courier New">/tmp/motd</font>,
copies the data sent over the channel into it, and closes the
file and socket.</p>

<p>The client connects to the server using <font
face="Courier New">dp_connect</font>, giving the hostname and
port number of the waiting server. After connecting, the client
opens <font face="Courier New">/etc/motd</font>, copies it to the
channel, and closes the file and socket.</p>

<p>Note that once a channel is opened, it is treated as any other
file: it can be read from, written to, or checked for the EOF
condition (which, in the case of TCP, this means the connection
has been closed).</p>

<p><font size="5"><b>New Features</b></font></p>

<p>The features described above were available in earlier
versions of Tcl-DP. In version 4.0, we added several new
features. This section describes those features.</p>

<p>In addition to TCP, UDP and IP multicast, DP 4.0 supports
communication via serial ports and email. No matter what its
type, a channel is opened using the dp_connect command and
supports the same input/output operations. The mechanism allows
one channel to be substituted for another in most programs &#150;
only the channel creation and configuration options (issued
through the Tcl <font face="Courier New">fconfigure</font>
command) differ. For example, by changing the parameters to <font
face="Courier New">dp_connect</font> and deleting the call to <font
face="Courier New">dp_accept</font> in Figure 2, we can transfer
the file over a serial line instead of a TCP connection, as shown
in Figure 3.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="1"><img src="dp97.h4.gif"
width="575" height="176"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3">Figure 3 &#150; Communication
over a serial connection</font></p>

<p>The Tcl-DP RPC mechanism has also been changed and enhanced.
Recursive and out-of-order RPCs are now supported. This point
will be covered in detail below. Perhaps the most important new
ability is that RPCs can now be performed over any Tcl channel as
long as it has been registered with the <font face="Courier">dp_admin</font>
command. More precisely, once a channel is created, the program
can call <font face="Courier New">dp_admin register chanID</font>,
which creates a file handler so that an inbound RPC request is
automatically processed. Calling <font face="Courier New">dp_admin
delete chanID</font> disables this behavior. The significance of
this feature is that <font face="Courier New">dp_RPC</font> and <font
face="Courier New">dp_RDO</font> can be performed over any
channel, although <font face="Courier New">dp_RPC</font> should
only be performed over reliable channels since packet loss can
cause a program to hang while waiting for a response from the
server.</p>

<p>Another new feature in DP 4.0 is <i>filters</i>. Filters sit
between the program and the channel, transparently modifying data
(e.g., encrypting/decrypting it). DP 4.0 has two types of
filters: <i>plugin filters</i> and <i>filter channels</i>. </p>

<p>A plugin filter is designed for the common case where the data
is modified using a functional interface. Encryption and
decryption are examples of plugin filters. To create a plugin
filter, the programmer call dp_connect plugfilter, passing in
three parameters: the channel to use for input/output, and two
filter functions, one for input and one for output.</p>

<p>Figure 4 shows how to use a plugin filter. In this example, a
server accepts a connection from a client (the first three lines
of code), and then attaches an exclusive-or (xor) filter to that
channel to weakly encrypt the data. Any data written to the
channel is transparently filtered by exclusive-or&#146;ing it
with a key (the key can be changed using the <font
face="Courier New">fconfigure</font> command on the plugin
channel). To decrypt the data, the user needs another xor plugin
filter on the receiving side.</p>

<p>DP 4.0 comes with a uuencode/decode filter, a xor excryption
filter, a hex to binary conversion filter, and a <font
face="Courier">tclfilter</font> plugin which allows any Tcl
procedure to be used as a filter. New filters are easy to write
(they require two procedures), and are registered using a C API.</p>

<p>The filter mechanism is general and powerful. For example, by
using uuencode filters, binary data can be read from, or written
to, channels. We have used filters to provide a simple command
line interface to a video camera whose pan/zoom/tilt is
controlled by a binary protocol over an RS232 interface. We
believe it is possible to use plugin filters to provide APIs for
secure communication, authentication, and gateways to binary RPC
mechanisms.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><img src="dp97.h5.gif"
width="577" height="100"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3">Figure 4 &#150; Attaching a
plugin filter</font></p>

<p>Certain tasks are difficult or impossible to perform using
plugin filters. For these cases, filter channels are appropriate.
Filter channels are complete channels with configurable options
and I/O routines. A filter channel is created using the <font
face="Courier New">dp_connect</font> command, passing in the
channel type as the first argument and a flag indicating the
channel to use for input/output. </p>

<p>To understand why filter channels are needed, consider the
following scenario. A user needs to transmit datagrams over a
stream channel (e.g., TCP). Since the channel has stream
semantics, the datagram boundaries will be lost in transmission.
In other words, if the user sends two datagrams
&quot;message1&quot; and &quot;message2&quot; over the channel,
the receiver might read &quot;mess&quot; on the first read, and
&quot;age1message2&quot; on a second read.</p>

<p>A simple way to keep the datagram boundaries is to build <i>packetizer</i>,
which attaches a length field to each message. At the receiver, a
<i>depacketizer</i> reads the length field and returns either a
whole packet or nothing (in the case of a partial read). It is
difficult to build a packetizer using plugin because they only
provide functional filtering. In this case, a filter channel is
used.</p>

<p>With filter channels, it is possible to build protocol stacks
that provide, for example, flow control and guaranteed
transmission over unreliable channels (any takers?).</p>

<p><font size="5"><b>Implementation</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><i>Channels</i></font></p>

<p>Since version 7.5, Tcl has performed all I/O via <i>Tcl_Channels</i>.
Figure 5 shows a block diagram of Tcl-DP&#146;s I/O system. The
Tcl_Channel abstraction pushes all I/O operations into a <i>channel
driver</i>, so that a generic set of operations can be performed
on any communications method. For instance, to read data from a
channel, one calls the Tcl_Read() function, which will invoke the
channel driver&#146;s input method to retrieve data available on
that channel. DP 4.0 provides drivers for 5 channel types: TCP,
UDP, IP multicast, serial ports and email. The <font
face="Courier New">dp_RPC</font> and <font face="Courier New">dp_RDO</font>
commands sit above the Tcl I/O layer, which allows us to use any
channel for RPC communication. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="dp97.h6.gif" width="186" height="211"></p>

<p><font size="4"><i>RPC</i></font></p>

<p>The implementation of RPCs changed significantly in DP 4.0.
The new mechanism allows RPCs to be issued over any Tcl channel,
and handles duplicate or out of order return of RPCs. In
addition, the protocol contains no binary data (unlike previous
versions), which allows a Tcl-only implementation of RPC handlers
using Tcl&#146;s socket command. These changes make the new
protocol incompatible with previous versions, but we felt the new
features and bug fixes justified the incompatibility. </p>

<p>Figure 6 shows the layout of an RPC/RDO packet. <i>Length</i>
is a six digit decimal string that gives the size of the entire
packet, including the length field itself. <i>Space</i> is a
delimiter between fields and is simply the space character. <i>Type</i>
is a one byte token character that denotes the type of this
packet. For types of packets are defined: RPC (&#145;e&#146;),
RDO (&#145;d&#146;), error (&#145;x&#146;), or return value
(&#145;r&#146;). <i>ID</i> is a six digit decimal string that
specifies an identifier for the RPC message (and its return
value). It is used in processing out-of-order RPCs, as explained
below. Finally, <i>msg</i> is the Tcl command to be evaluated.</p>

<p>For example, the command <font face="Courier New">dp_RPC tcp0
puts hi</font> generates in the packet</p>

<p>&quot;<font face="Courier New"> 23 e 1 puts hi</font>&quot;</p>
<div align="center"><center>

    </tr>
</table>
</center></div>

<p align="center"><font size="3">Figure 6 &#150; RPC packet
format</font></p>

<p>When a message arrives on an RPC channel, Tcl executes a file
callback to process the message. This callback reads the message,
buffering partial reads if necessary. It then processes the
packet as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If the packet is an RPC (as determined by the <i>type</i>
        field), the command is evaluated. If there is an error, <i>interp-&gt;errorInfo</i>
        is returned to the sender in <i>msg</i>. Otherwise, <i>interp-&gt;result</i>
        is returned to the sender in <i>msg</i>.</li>
    <li>If the packet is an RDO, the command is evaluated.
        Nothing is returned to the sender.</li>
    <li>If the packet is an error code or a return value, the <i>id</i>
        field is used as an index into the <i>activation record</i>
        for the RPC, which is described below. The RPC is marked
        as received, the error condition set (if appropriate),
        and <i>msg</i> copied into the activation record.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever an RPC is sent, an identifier (<i>id</i>) is
generated and an activation record is created. This activation
record tracks all currently executing RPCs, and allows for
out-of-order and recursive RPCs. It is stored in a table, using <i>id</i>
as an index. To understand the function of the activation record,
consider the following example.</p>

<p>A Tcl-DP process sends an RPC (id=1) to host A. DP creates an
activation record for the RPC and waits in an event loop for the
return message. While waiting, another event (e.g., a timer
event) triggers the issuance of a second RPC (id=2) to host B.
Again, DP DP creates an activation record for the RPC and waits
in a new event loop for the return message. If RPC #1 now
returns, it can not be processed immediately, since the current
event loop, and associated call stack, is for RPC #2. Thus, DP
simply records the RPC return value in the activation record
associated with RPC #1. When RPC #2 returns, it is marked as
received, breaking the event loop and return to the original
loop. This loop exits immediately, since the activation record
indicates the RPC is received.</p>

<p>The surprising thing about the mechanism is that its
expression in C is extremely elegant. The callback for processing
a return value or error message just marks the appropriate
activation record. The event loop simply processes one event
until the associated activation record indicates the return value
has been received.</p>

<p><font size="5"><b>Open Issues</b></font></p>

<p>While designing DP 4.0, we ran into several problems, which we
discuss in this section.</p>

<p><font size="4"><i>Peeking and Tcl I/O</i></font></p>

<p>In previous versions of DP, peeking was allowed on socket
reads. Peeking allows a <font face="Courier New">read</font>
function call to return a portion of the input available on a
channel without consuming the data. It is useful when processing
input messages, since a message header can be read to decide
which routine should process the message.</p>

<p>The Tcl I/O subsystem buffers all channel input.
Unfortunately, this buffering also makes peeking on a channel
impossible. Consider the following example: a user wishes to peek
at the first 2 bytes of a 12-byte message on a UDP channel.
Suppose the message is &quot;123456789abc&quot;. Assume we <font
face="Courier New">fconfigure</font> the socket for peeking, so
that the <font face="Courier New">read()</font> system call does
not consume the available data on the socket. When Tcl calls the
channel&#146;s input procedure to read the data on the socket; it
reads 10 bytes, returning 2 bytes (&quot;12&quot;) to the caller
and buffering the rest (&quot;3456789a&quot;). When the program
attempts to read the message out of the socket, Tcl will
concatenate the 8 bytes of buffered data with data available on
the socket, resulting in a 20 byte message
(&quot;3456789a123456789abc&quot;).</p>

<p>We provide a work-around for this problem using the <font
face="Courier New">dp_recv</font> command, which allows direct,
unbuffered access to a channel&#146;s input procedure.</p>

<p><font size="4"><i>RPC over unreliable channels</i></font></p>

<p>The dp_RPC command blocks until a return value is received. In
DP, the RPC procedure waits in an event loop, repeatedly calling <font
face="Courier">Tcl_DoOneEvent()</font> until an answer for the
RPC is received. Unfortunately, this also means that when an RPC
message (or its return value) is lost, the dp_RPC call will never
return. Since DP 4.0 allows RPC over unreliable (e.g., UDP)
channels, such an event is possible. We see three work-arounds
for this case. First, one can always use <font face="Courier New">dp_RDO</font>
to remotely invoke a command. Since <font face="Courier New">dp_RDO</font>
does not block, the program will lock up when a message is lost.
A second option is to use the <font face="Courier New">&#150;timeout</font>
flag of <font face="Courier New">dp_RPC</font>. This flag creates
a timer event that marks the RPC&#146;s activation record as
complete after a specified time, causing the event loop to
terminate and the <font face="Courier New">dp_RPC</font> call to
return an error. The third option is to provide a filter channel
that implements retransmission for the unreliable channel, and
then issue RPCs over that channel. We have not yet written such a
filter channel.</p>

<h2><font size="5"><b>Status and Conclusion</b></font></h2>

<p>In this paper, we described the new features and
implementation of Tcl-DP 4.0. Tcl-DP 4.0 is a dynamically
loadable version of Tcl-DP which adds several new features
including new channel types, channel filters, and better RPC
support. Tcl-DP is freely available from
